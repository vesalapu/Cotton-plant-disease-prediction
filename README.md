# Cotton-plant-disease-prediction

## Context:
 Agriculture is an important backbone for any country and India is considered to be an agro-based country.It not only boosts various industries such as food industry and textile industry but when it comes to textile industry cotton producing crops hold a special position amongst all other textile crops.Though growing cotton is not an easy task and it requires a lot of expertise and farmers have to face a lot of hardships in the process.After facing so many hardships, if their crops get exposed to diseases and are not treated timely then it affects the crops and also life of farmers to a great extent.So, it will be better to have an AI agent take care of the plants to let us know if the crops are suffering from any disease or so.This can be identified by looking at the leaves of the plant.

## Content:
 In this dataset,provided with images that belong to 4 classes : diseased leaf , diseased plant , fresh leaf and fresh plant. The objective of this study is to create a CNN model to help us predict whether these image of the leaf/plant belong to the diseased category or the healthy category. Working with images is pretty memory consuming, especially if you read and preprocess all of them at the same time.
